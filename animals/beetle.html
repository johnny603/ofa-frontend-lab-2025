    <!-- Description paragraph -->
    <p>
      The <strong>rainbow leaf beetle</strong> (<em>Chrysolina cerealis</em>) is a stunning member of the leaf beetle family, known for its brilliant <strong>iridescent coloration</strong> that shifts between green, blue, copper, and gold depending on the angle of light. These small beetles, typically measuring <strong>6-8mm in length</strong>, are found across Europe and have been introduced to North America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rainbow leaf beetles are herbivorous insects that feed primarily on <strong>mint family plants</strong>, including wild mint, spearmint, and other aromatic herbs. Their larvae develop in the soil, feeding on plant roots, while adults emerge in spring to feed on leaves and reproduce during the warmer months.
